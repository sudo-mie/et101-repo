Hi S,

Thanks for the update, good to know that the case is being worked on! Could you provide an estimated time for when the extension will be filed?

For context, I submitted the questionnaire and required documents early this year, well before the current busy period. Also my colleague, who is my peer and has the same H-1B expiration date, has already had their extension filed, so it seems my case has been delayed for some time now.

Iâ€™d really appreciate any visibility you can provide on the expected filing date.

Thanks,
