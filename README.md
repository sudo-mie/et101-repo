# et101-repo

For me, I'll continue work on BATS auction timing updates. Plan to only use quantfile - will read the freeze offset from experiment quantfile, and use offsets keyed by venue. If venue not present in quantfile, will use the freeze time from trading schedule. Updated the draft on branch - <>

Still a rough draft, haven't got too much time to update today as working on Rota issue
