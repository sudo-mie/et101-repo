## Mid-year Review Summary

### 1. Highlights from H1 Projects: Worked on more complex projects

**TPC prediction using LightGBM**

- deepen my understanding of backtesting and tooling (especially journal and storyboard replay).

**Enhanced placement signal implementation**

**Auction improvements (early quote & close auction participation)**

- worked with Monali and Song; more understanding of all close auction logic

### 2. Key Learnings & Skills Gained
**Earlier involvement in project lifecycle**

I feel like I was involved in the projects from the early design stage (like EPS and LGBM), which helped me think more end-to-end about the workflows and the development plan.

**Technical – coding and design**

I learned more about clean code design and long-term thinking, such as refactoring rolling data trackers for risk checks and trailing volumes.
            Also learned more about the coding skills from you and jiaming’s comments and feedback.

**Stronger tooling fluency**

I have a deeper understanding with storyboard, journal, and replay. Such as through the investigation for NPE last week and debugging the journaling issues for LGBM TPC

**Deeper understanding of e-trading algos**

Participating in rota and shadowing project discussions gave me a broader context of how the algo works 


### 3. Areas for Improvement

**Code review participation**

You've mentioned this before, and I’ve started reviewing more PRs. I aim to increase both frequency and depth in H2.


**Initiative in early-stage project scoping**

I’d like to take more initiative in the design and planning stages of new features.


### 4. H2 Goals

- Continue building technical depth, especially on larger-scale system components.

- Broaden my scope and impact, by implementing end-to-end feature

- Stay curious and build product awareness, especially in how trading decisions translate to business outcomes.


### 5. Appreciation & Feedback
I really appreciate how you provide thoughtful feedback, for both code reviews and during team discussions. Your attention to design details and trade-offs has helped me learn a lot. Also thanks for often taking the time to explain all the context and details about how things work. (e.g. storyboard NPE give me a fresh understanding of how storyboard work)


I also find it motivating that you’re always transparent about priorities and context. It helps me understand the “why” behind what we’re building and makes me want to contribute more actively.


I don’t have any suggestion to you, I feel like I’ve learned a ton from working closely with you, and I’d continue to do so under your guidance going forward
