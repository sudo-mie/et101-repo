# et101-repo

1. "I suggest we create a new ... and rename .."
=> Parameter like min duration will be shared for continuous and close auction TPC. The other specific APIs are renamed to clarify continuous vs close auction. So I think we can keep them in a same file for now.


2. Let's rename it to setLightGbmContin...
=> This parameter is already in PRS file in prod. I don't think we want to rename it, otherwise the current PRS file won't work


3. Let's rename it to isLightGb
=> same as previous comment. The field name is matching the current PRS file, so only updated the API name

5.
