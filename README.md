### Muse Signal Frequency Update - Impact on Wasp

Hi Rajesh,

We've been discussing with the Muse team regarding the update frequency of Muse signals, and we'd like some input from tech team before proceeding. 

Currently, Muse signals (e.g. vwapEligVol for volume counting) seem to refresh every 5 seconds, which explains some short-term discrepancies we observed against Waspâ€™s eligibleVol.

Updating every 5-second is much slower than we expected, and looking to see if we can increase the frequency. If the Muse team increase the update frequency (e.g. from 5 seconds to 1 second), do you know if there would be any potential impact on the Wasp side? Or if you know any related insight on the connection between muse and wasp.

Appreciate any input from your side. Feel free to check the attached email thread for full context, and let me know if you have any question.

Thanks,
Situ
