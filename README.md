Thanks for the suggestion. Also considered this approach, but I think it is more intuitive to offer the selection "whether or not ignoring redraw" than multiple APIs just for different definitions of start time. This is also similar to the naming of features, e.g. we are using "orderDurationVolTimeIgnoreRedraw" instead of "orderDurationVolTimeFrom(Effective/Redraw)Time". Also open to other input, let me know your thoughts
