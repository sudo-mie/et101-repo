Subject: Follow-up on H-1B Extension Filing – Still Showing "Gathering Documents"

Hi xxx,

I hope you’re doing well.

I wanted to follow up again regarding my H-1B extension. I still see the status as "gathering documents" in the system, and I haven’t received any updates for over a month.

I fully understand that once the case is filed, it may take ~8 months to get approved — but I believe it’s important that the filing itself happens as soon as possible, especially since I’ve submitted all required documents much earlier this year. My case became eligible for filing on March 30, and it's now already early May.

Also I mentioned previously, I have plans to go abroad in October, so I’ve already flagged the urgency on this. I was told preivously that someone is working on my case, but I haven’t seen any progress. Could you please help confirm that it is being actively handled? And could you let me know the current status and next steps?

I’d really appreciate your help in moving this forward as soon as possible. Thanks again.

Best regards,
Situ

Yes I have a chat with V and x. They just replied and started look into this this morning.

Do you think we can reply what we know so far?

On that day, LION primary exchange was changed several times LION.N -> LION.OQ -> LION.N -> LION.OQ -> LION.N
The order has volume aggregator registered to ric LION.N's container. But at that time, LION.OQ is the correct ric to use for LION from TickRecorder to receive MOOP updates. So the order with LION.N is not receiving any volume updates. As a result, has 0 tpc and 0 target qty. When LION.OQ -> LION.N, a new container is created instead of the original one order regsitered to, so still no volume updates.

We think this happened due to LION's primary exchange changed back and forth in the same day.
