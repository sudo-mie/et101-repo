Hi <>,

I’d like to clarify the trades in question.

The transactions involved are for company stock that I had purchased through the "employee share purchase program" at the time of me just joining. I was under the impression that since this stock was acquired via the program and subject to the required holding period, I would be able to sell it during the trading window without needing pre-clearance. So after satisfying the holding period, I sold the shares during an open trading window. The system also showed that the shares were eligible for sale, so I thought the transaction was permitted.

I’ve just reviewed the policy, and realized that it is indeed required for this scenario. I sincerely apologize for missing this and for not submitting a trade request as I should have. Please let me know if there's any further information or action you need from my side.

Best regards,
