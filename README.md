# et101-repo


I also backtested this order on my end, I think I can repro the issue. Both tpc and target are different from bop and storyboard

I was not able to load this model file for permission issue, I used the old model file

I also tried to print the values (adding the `System.out.println`) into a csv. I think the printed value align with the value in BOP

We've been using the printed values for previous lgbm backtest, I think it should be reliable?
